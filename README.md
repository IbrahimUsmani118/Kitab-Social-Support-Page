## 📖 FAQs

### 1) What is Kitab Social?
A simple, secure social + messaging app to share posts, media, and stay connected via feeds and DMs.

### 2) How does duplicate-image blocking work?
- You can upload the **same image** up to **two** times.  
- The **third** attempt is blocked to reduce spam and clutter.  
- We compute a **non-reversible perceptual hash** of your image to detect duplicates; the hash can’t reconstruct the original image.

### 3) What permissions do you request on iOS and why?
- **Camera** – capture photos/videos.  
- **Photo Library** – select and (optionally) save media.  
- **Microphone** – audio/video posts/messages.  
- **Notifications (optional)** – activity and message alerts.  
- **Contacts (optional)** – friend discovery if you opt in.  
Manage permissions anytime in your device’s **Settings**.

### 4) How do I report a bug?
Include:  
- **Device & OS:** e.g., iPhone 13, iOS 18.0  
- **App version/build:** (Settings → About)  
- **Steps to reproduce:** numbered, from a fresh launch  
- **Expected vs. actual result**  
- **Screenshots/logs:** if available

### 5) How do I delete my account or data?
Use **Settings → Account → Delete Account** (if available). Otherwise email us and we’ll assist.
